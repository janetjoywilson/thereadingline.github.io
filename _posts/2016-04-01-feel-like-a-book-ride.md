title: It's Beginning To Feel Like A Book Ride

We’ve finalized our schedule and we’re so excited to share it with all of you next Wednesday.

This year’s book ride is a celebration of Jane Jacobs and June Callwood. We’ll ride along Bathurst, promoting this street as a prime north–south route, and hear from authors, librarians, city officials, and community organizers.

The book ride is free! Books will be for sale, and merchandise will be sold by our friends at Spacing magazine.

Stay tuned!
