Annnd our final author on The Reading Line is…Frank Viva! Frank will be reading at the Tundra Children’s Story Time, our last stop & read location on The Reading Line.

We’ll be at the Prince Edward Viaduct Parkette, opposite Castle Frank Station, the grassy park on the EAST side (in front of the school).

Frank Viva is an award-winning illustrator and designer living and working in Toronto. His first picture book Along a Long Road was a finalist for the Governor General’s Award for Illustration and was named one of The New York Times’ 10 Best Illustrated Children’s Books of 2011. His other books for children include A Long Way Away, A Trip to the Bottom of the World with Mouse and Young Frank, Architect. His art has appeared in many places such as The New York Times and the cover of the New Yorker and on the illustrated stationary produced by his company Whigby. Frank runs a branding and design agency in Toronto and is past president of the Advertising & Design Club of Canada. But making books is his favourite thing to do. www.vivaandco.com

The trio of authors & illustrators (Matt James, Julie Kraulis and Frank Viva) will be appearing at 4 pm on May 30. After nap and snack time! Note: no washroom access that we know of. We will aim to wrap by 4:30 pm.
