Today is the 100th anniversary of Jane Jacobs’ birthday. Events are being held in her honour all around the world, and the Google Doodle is all about Jane!

Here in Toronto, under the umbrella #Jane100, events are rolling out from May 4th, 2016 to May 4th, 2017. One of these events is our book ride on Bathurst, which pays tribute to Jane Jacobs and June Callwood. This week NOW magazine recognized #BooksOnBathurst as one of the “best Jane100 events in Toronto.”

This morning, to celebrate Jane’s birthday and build on the buzz, we did #bookride street outreach along Bloor at Bathurst and Spadina, and at the bike box on Harbord at Spadina. Check out photos here.

We then rode to City Hall, where we are now awaiting the important and long-awaited vote on Bike Lanes on Bloor…fingers crossed.
