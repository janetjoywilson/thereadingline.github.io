title: Please Vote For The Reading Line As Best Reading Series In Toronto
---

The Reading Line is nominated for NOW magazine’s *Best Reading Series* in Toronto. We’re delighted and humbled!

Our previous three reading series have taken us from The Green Line to Bloor Street to Bathurst. We’ve featured authors including Gary Barwin, S. Bear Bergman, Anne Michaels, Fatima Syed, Alissa York, Tanya Neumeyer, Vincent Lam, Shawn Micallef, John Lorinc, Catherine Bush, and many many more. This year‘s book ride paid tribute to Jane Jacobs and June Callwood. We’ve partnered with independent presses and multinational publishing houses, the library, non-profits, food vendors, magazines, a pedal-powered delivery service, a historical centre, and independent bookstores.

We’re now planning our fourth annual book festival, to take place in September 2017 (yep, we plan way ahead). Our book rides are always free, with a commitment to inclusive and diverse public programming. We’re the only reading series on two wheels that we know of, and we also aim for reading locations on the route that are fully accessible via transit and other means. We’re currently applying for funding that will help us increase accessibility and visibility for all participants, and strengthen the scope of our programming. We have far to go, and we’d love your support and suggestions along the way.

Please VOTE!

Thank you!
