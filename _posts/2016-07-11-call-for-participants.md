We’re programming next year’s book ride, because we are nothing if not prepared. We are committed to diverse and inclusive programming and want to ensure we represent voices from a range of communities: Indigenous, Black, refugee, LGBTQ2S+, and more. Who do YOU want to see on our book ride in 2017? We welcome your suggestions. Poetry, fiction, non-fiction, graphic novels, kids’ books, and more. Thank you.
