Introducing…the Tundra Children’s Story Time! Our last stop & read location on The Reading Line.

After Alissa York’s reading at the Prince Edward Viaduct Parkette, opposite Castle Frank Station, the grassy park on the WEST side, we will cross to the EAST side (in front of the school), where we will hear from a trio of children’s authors and illustrators. After Matt James we’ll hear from… Julie Kraulis!

Toronto-based artist and illustrator and author Julie Kraulis is passionate about ideas: the unexpected, profound, whimsical, smart. Her creative journey is one of hope and disbelief, soaring and stumbling. All that she encounters in this wide world becomes her inspiration and she delights in sharing these treasures with others. She is a stop and smell the roses kind of gal who loves to create. [Check out her website](http://juliekraulis.com)

This trio will be appearing at 4 pm on May 30. After nap and snack time! Note: no washroom access that we know of. We will aim to wrap by 4:30 pm.
