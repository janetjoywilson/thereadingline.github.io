We are just two sleeps away from the biggest book ride of the year!

Books on Bathurst takes place on Saturday, May 28. The ride celebrates two authors and activists: Jane Jacobs and June Callwood.

Two-wheeled festivities kick off at Fort York Library at 3 pm. The library is celebrating its two-year anniversary this weekend, so it’s a great time to explore this beautiful space. At Fort York we’ll hear from Ted Belke, the Branch Head. Joe Cressy, City Councillor for Ward 20, will speak about cycling in this neighbourhood. Then we’ll hear from the authors: Grace O’Connell, author of Magnified World, and Tanis Rideout, author of Above All Things.

From there we’ll ride north on Bathurst, accompanied by the police bicycle unit. We’ll stop at Tollkeeper’s Cottage on Davenoport, where we’ll be greeted with lemonade and cookies! (Available by donation.) The manager of this local museum will speak, and Joe Mihevc, City Councillor for Ward 21, will address the issues facing cyclists in his ward. Then Denise Pinto, executive director of Jane’s Walk, will speak about Jacobs’ centenary and the events being planned this year to celebrate Jacobs’ legacy. We’ll then focus on a new book that considers whether Jacobs’ ideas of city-building are being adhered to in an age of rapid growth and diversity. One of the editors of Subdivided: City-Building in an Age of Hyper-Diversity, John Lorinc, will speak about the collection, and a contributor, Fatima Syed, will speak about finding spaces for spirituality in the city.

It’s all downhill from there, but only in the literal sense! We’ll ride to June Callwood Park for our grand finale. Mike Layton, City Councillor for Ward 19, will speak about cycling in this neighbourhood. Councillor Layton has been a big supporter of bike lanes and contraflow lanes throughout the city, and he was present when the park was opened in 2014, so we’re really looking forward to hearing from him. Jacquelyn Gulati, Manager, Cycling Infrastructure & Programs, Transportation Services at City of Toronto, will be riding with us throughout the day and seeing firsthand what cycling on Bathurst is really like; we’re curious to hear her thoughts on how we can make this street more bike-friendly. And then we’ll hear from the authors! S. Bear Bergman, author of Blood, Marriage, Wine and Glitter, and publisher of Flamingo Rampant books for kids, and Anne Michaels, Toronto Poet Laureate and author of Fugitive Pieces.

Books will be for sale at Fort York Library and June Callwood Park, sold by our friends at Spacing.

You don’t have to ride to participate! Come for a little or a lot! See you this Saturday!
