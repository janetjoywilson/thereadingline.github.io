Contest alert!

Today marks the 10th anniversary of Jane Jacobs’ death, 10 days before what would have been her 100th birthday, on May 4th.

To celebrate ‪#‎Jane100‬ The Reading Line is giving away 10 copies of a new collection of conversations with Jane, from Melville House. We’ll give away one copy per day.

How to enter: Simply take a photo of yourself reading any book by Jane Jacobs, June Callwood, or any of the authors appearing at ‪#‎BooksOnBathurst‬ on May 28, and share it with The Reading Line on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, tagging it ‪#‎bookridecontest‬.

Catch yourself reading! Good luck!
