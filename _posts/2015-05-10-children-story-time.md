Introducing…the Tundra Children’s Story Time! Our last stop & read location on The Reading Line.

After Alissa York’s reading at the Prince Edward Viaduct Parkette, opposite Castle Frank Station, the grassy park on the WEST side, we will cross to the EAST side (in front of the school), where we will hear from a trio of children’s authors and illustrators. First up…Matt James!

Matt James is a painter, illustrator and musician. His books have won many prestigious awards including the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, the Marilyn Baillie Picture Book Award, the New Mexico Book Award and the Governor General’s Award for Illustration.

Matt will be appearing at 4 pm on May 30. After nap and snack time! Note: no washroom access that we know of. We will aim to wrap by 4:30 pm.
