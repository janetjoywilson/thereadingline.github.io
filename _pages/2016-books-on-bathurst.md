  - title: Jane Jacobs & June Callwood
    img: fa-road
    body: Our program featured authors and special guests, with a focus on celebrating authors and activists Jane Jacobs and June Callwood in what would have been the year of Jane’s 100th birthday. We rode near Jane’s home in the Annex, and ended the ride at June Callwood Park near the base of Bathurst.

    body: We started our ride at the majestic Fort York Library at the base of Bathurst Street. The library was celebrating its two-year anniversary, and was built to serve the residents flocking to this part of town with its new condo developments. The library also honours the past in its design, incorporating elements that speak to the historical, geographic, and literary landscape. We then rode north to the historic Tollkeeper’s Cottage at Bathurst and Davenport, which once marked the shoreline of Lake Iroquois and was a key trail for First Nations for centuries.
  - title: Population Density

    body: Our goal for the Book Ride was to raise awareness of a street in the city that is seeing increased density from the south with the Fort York condominiums and redevelopments along Bathurst. This much-used north–south corridor requires improved bike infrastructure. Our trip was to illustrate that a street with libraries, schools, daycares, residences and businesses requires a complete street focus.
